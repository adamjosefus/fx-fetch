**Response** module provides constructors and utilities for managing immutable interpretations of HTTP responses.

## The Response Type

A `Response` represents immutable and clonable HTTP Response data. It is base element of Response module.

```ts twoslash showLineNumbers=false
import { Response } from 'fx-fetch';

type Type = Response.Response;
```

## The Input Type

A `Response.Input` represents all the possible inputs that can be used to create a `Response`.

Concrete types that make up the `Input` union:

```ts twoslash showLineNumbers=false
import { Response } from 'fx-fetch';

type Type = Response.Response.Input;
```

- `globalThis.Response` — vanilla JS response
- [`Response.Response.Parts`](#from-responseparts) — Object with response parts
- `Response.Response` — Existing Response can be used too
