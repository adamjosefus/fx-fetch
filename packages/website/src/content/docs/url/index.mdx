The `Url` module is one of the core building blocks of `fx-fetch`.
The module contains functions and types to create and manipulate URLs.

## The Url Type

A `Url` represents immutable and clonable HTTP URL data. It is a base element of the Url module.

```ts twoslash showLineNumbers=false
import { Url } from 'fx-fetch';

type Type = Url.Url;
```
