import { Tabs, TabItem, Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A production-ready solution for safe & simple HTTP fetching built with
[EffectTS](https://effect.website/). **Designed with great developer
experience in mind.**

- ✅ **Production-ready** — Used in production by [Ematiq](https://www.ematiq.com) since February 2025
- ✅ **Immutable & Clonable** — Follows functional programming principles
- ✅ **Safe by default** — Prevents common pitfalls with HTTP fetching
- ✅ **Cross-platform** — Works in all modern browsers, Bun, Deno, and Node.js
- ✅ **Effect-based** — Seamless integration with the Effect ecosystem
- ✅ **Testable** — Easy mocking and testing with service-based architecture
- ✅ **Dual API** — Familiar syntax from [EffectTS](https://effect.website/docs/code-style/dual)
- ✅ **Simple** — It is just fetch! No more complex concepts to learn.

### „And what about `@effect/platform` HttpApi?“

`@effect/platform` HttpApi is an unstable package nowadays. Some methods are still implemented using `Effect.die`.
Most importantly, however, it is an HTTP client. This makes it mostly useful for backend and full-stack applications.
In many real-world scenarios, however, your server is not under your direct control _(e.g. other teams, third-party services,
other language edge functions, etc.)._

FxFetch is designed to be used in like a browser `fetch` but with type-safety, immutability, and ergonomics in mind.
